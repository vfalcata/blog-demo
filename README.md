To circumvent any security risks with previous commits, this project is uploaded as a single commit. As this is only a demo project and not a production application this is sufficient.

This is a Blog application built with a microservice architecture. The event broker is scratch built. This project serves as an indepth exploration to the implementation of a microservice application, hence the inline comment and notes.

It requires skaffold, docker, kubernetes, in the appropriate packages for your operating system.

In order to run this application use the command in the root directory:

```skaffold dev```
